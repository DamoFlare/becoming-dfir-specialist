🕵️‍♂️ From Sysadmin to DFIR Specialist

This repository documents my 6-month practical journey from working as a system administrator in cybersecurity to becoming a Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) specialist.The goal: move beyond log monitoring and into evidence-based investigation and technical storytelling.

🎯 Objective

To build solid, hands-on skills in:

Memory forensics (RAM dumps)

Disk and artifact analysis

Network traffic reconstruction (PCAP, Zeek)

Malware behavior and persistence investigation

Incident reconstruction and timeline creation

✍️ Why this project?

I believe technical forensics isn't about just parsing logs — it's about reconstructing narratives.This repo is my investigative lab, where I learn to turn traces into timelines, indicators into insights, and raw data into technical stories worth telling.

📌 Career Focus
